# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

## Problem Statement
A retail store wants to better understand its customers and tailor marketing strategies based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to group customers into distinct segments using a K-means clustering algorithm. This segmentation will help the store in targeted marketing and personalized customer engagement.

# Dataset Details
The dataset contains information about customers' purchase history, such as the amount spent, frequency of purchases, and other relevant features.

# K-means Clustering Algorithm
K-means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering similar data points into groups or clusters. In this case, the algorithm will be applied to the customer dataset to group customers based on their purchasing behavior.

# Files
* TASK_02.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, and K-means clustering.
* Mall_Customers.csv: CSV file containing the customer purchase history dataset.
* readme.md: Readme file with information about the problem statement, dataset, and the K-means clustering algorithm.

# Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb.
2. Run the cells in order to load and explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and apply the K-means clustering algorithm.
3. Analyze the clusters to understand different customer segments.
4. Use the insights gained from clustering to tailor marketing strategies for each customer segment.
